# practice-advanced-SQL-Queries-Jill-S

While completing this project, I learned a lot about all of the different ways to create advanced SQL queries!  I learned how to join data from different tables in different ways depending on what the tables have in common.  I learned how to use aggregate functions like SUM, MAX, and MIN and included them within a GROUP BY query.  The hardest thing for me to wrap my brain around at first was the difference between the WHERE and the HAVING clauses.  I understood the flow of them, but I was confused by the examples in the lesson, and the filters that were being presented to me.  After playing around with them for a bit, I figured out the difference between the two queries that I was comparing...one was using total_amount and one was using MAX(total_amount).  I feel like a have a pretty good grasp on all of the advanced SQL queries that were given to us now!
